\chapter{Evaluation}
The cpu evaluation is done with Modelsim from MentorGraphics. Individual testbenches were created to test each separate cpu component as well as for the complete cpu.

The complete cpu passed the complete simulation with a simulated perfect memory, that means without either instruction or data access stalls. Furthermore it also passed 
the simulation with a simulated real memory.

For the implementation on the fpga a hdllab code was prepared with the cpu, memory, uart and pll components already integrated as well as the LEDs, clock and reset interface
with the fpga. The cpu passed this simulation with the counter program, outputing the counter value to the LEDs output.
