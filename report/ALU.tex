\section{ALU}
This section describes the ALU (arithmetic logic unit). The implementation of the ALU has three parallel data buses consisting of two 32bit input operands and a 32bit result output.
Furthermore, there is an 6bit input for the opcode. The ALU can perform 7 operations: add, sub, and, or, sll, slt and interconnect one of the two inputs to the result output. 
Additionally, there is an zero output flag if the operation results in zero.
