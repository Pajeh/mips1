\chapter{Introduction}
In the HDL Lab is a practical exercise of a hdl language implementation. This semester the task is the implementation of a MIPS I microcontroller in vhdl. 
A requirement to this laboratory is the lecture HDL: Verilog and VHDL from Prof. Dr.-Ing. Klaus Hofmann.\\
The MIPS instruction set is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC). There are available references for 32 and 64-bit with many revisions. This microcontroller reference is often used as an
hdl first project.\\

\section{Task}

The objective is to design, implement, synthesise and test a MIPS-I specified processor core on FPGA. The hardware description langugage is VHDL and the target technology is a Virtex5 from Xilinx.
The synthesised microcontroller must be able to run at 50 MHz with a desirable frequency of 200 MHz. The microcontroller must use a pipeline of a minimum of 2 and maximum of 6 stages.
The following subcomponents are mandatory: ALU, datapath and controlpath.
