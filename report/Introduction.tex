\chapter{Introduction}
In the HDL Lab is a practical exercise of a hardware description language implementation. This semester the task is the implementation of a MIPS I microcontroller in vhdl. 
A requirement to this laboratory is the lecture HDL: Verilog and VHDL by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Klaus Hofmann.\\
MIPS is an acronym for Microprocessor without interlocked pipeline stages.
The MIPS instruction set is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC). There are available references for 32 and 64-bit with many revisions.\\
MIPS was developed in the 80s with the intent to take fully advantage of pipelines. Nowadays this instruction set and structure 
is often used as an hdl first project. Commercially it is used embedded systems such as Windows CE devices, routers, residential gateways and video
consoles such as Nintendo 64, Sony PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. \\

\section{Task}

The objective is to design, implement, synthesize and test a MIPS-I specified processor core on FPGA. 
The hardware description language is VHDL and the target technology is a Virtex5 from Xilinx.
The synthesized microcontroller must be able to run at 50 MHz with a desirable frequency of 200 MHz. 
The microcontroller must use a pipeline of a minimum of 2 and maximum of 6 stages.
The following sub-components are mandatory: ALU, data-path and control-path.\\
A counter test program shall run on the synthesized microcontroller, outputting the counter value
to eight LEDs on the FPGA board.
