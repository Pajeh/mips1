The CPU is divided in a control and a datapath blocks. In the datapath there is the pipeline made of five blocks:
\begin{itemize}
 \item IF: Instruction fetch
 \item ID: Instruction decode
 \item Ex: Execution
 \item Me: Memory stage
 \item WB: Writeback
\end{itemize}

The CPU interacts with two external memories and has also a clock and a reset input.
