This chapter describes the design of a MIPS 1 microcontroller. A microcontroller consists mostly of a processor core, memory and programmable inputs/outputs peripherals. 
This design implementation focus only on the processor core design.

This laboratory requires a microcontroller structure of at least a CPU containing a controlpath, datapath and an ALU. The created design uses this base with a 5-staged pipeline.
The CPU interacts with two external memories and has also a clock and a reset input. All of which are considered external to this design.
The CPU is divided in two base components: a control and a datapath block, as shown  in \autoref{fig:overview}.

In the datapath there is the pipeline made of five blocks: instruction fetch (IF), instruction decode (ID), execution (EX), memory stage (Me) and writeback (WB).

The following sections describe the central component ALU and the two base components: datapath and controlpath.
The cpu components structure is shown in \autoref{fig:cpu structure}:
